# Data Science projects made by Guillermo Ramírez Cárdenas
## Description:

:technologist: This repo contains the different Data projects that I made in 2023 from February to May. Each folder contains the name of the Data technique used in the different projects (.ipynb) found in it. 
Also each project has an introduction section explaining the problem to be solved.<br>

## Important:

:technologist: The "MY final project" folder is a project that I developed the idea and the ways to demonstrate a hypothesis that is "Why Spain should apply to host the World Cup in 2030", developing different techniques to demonstrate the profitability that would get.
